# Vedic Pandit — वैदिक पंडित

A .NET 8 + Angular 19 website for **drik panchang**, **muhurat search**, **mantra uchcharan** (chant-along with
per-word highlighting in 9 scripts) and **PanditJi**, a Claude-powered guide to the Dharma Granths that answers
from a verse library with exact citations instead of inventing shlokas.

## What makes it accurate

Panchang is computed astronomically for any location, not copied from a printed table.

| Component | Method |
|---|---|
| Sun | Truncated VSOP87 (Meeus ch. 32), ~1″ |
| Moon | ELP-2000/82 main terms (Meeus ch. 47), ~10″ |
| Ayanamsa | Lahiri (Chitrapaksha), calibrated |
| Sunrise | Upper limb + refraction (−0.833°) |
| Time | ΔT applied (TT vs UT), IANA time zones |

Verified against Drik Panchang (New Delhi):

- **26 Oct 2026** — tithi, nakshatra, yoga and karana end times all within 1 minute.
- **All 12 sankrantis of 2026** — within ±1 minute.
- **Festivals** are fixed by the correct kaal rather than sunrise alone:
  - madhyahna: Ram Navami, Ganesh Chaturthi
  - aparahna: Dussehra
  - pradosh: Diwali, Dhanteras, Karwa Chauth, Holika Dahan
  - nishita: Janmashtami, Maha Shivaratri, including the case where Ashtami spans neither midnight
  - Result for 2026: Diwali on Nov 8, Janmashtami on Sep 4, Dussehra on Oct 20.
- **Adhik masa** detected (Adhik Jyeshtha 17 May – 15 Jun 2026).

These cases live in `tests/VedicPandit.Tests/PanchangAccuracyTests.cs`.

The engine exists twice with identical math:

- **C#** — `src/VedicPandit.Infrastructure/Astronomy` and `Panchang` (authoritative, used by the API and PanditJi).
- **TypeScript** — `vedic-pandit-client/src/app/core/astro`. It powers the live "Right now" card and lets the site run fully in the browser when the API is not reachable.

> **Note:** keep the two in sync when changing rules.

## Features

- **Panchang**:
  - The five limbs with end times; kshaya tithis listed when two fall in one day.
  - Rahu Kaal, Yamaganda, Gulika, Abhijit and Brahma muhurat.
  - Day and night choghadiya, with the current slot highlighted.
  - Masa (Purnimanta or Amanta), Vikram and Shaka samvat, ritu, ayana, sun and moon rashi.
  - Sankranti moments, festivals and vrats.
  - Ekadashi by both rules: Smarta (tithi at sunrise; first day when it spans two sunrises) and Vaishnava (no Dashami at arunodaya, 96 minutes before sunrise). The page shows the one for your sampradaya.
- **Muhurat finder**:
  - 9 occasions: vivah, griha pravesh, vehicle, property, namakaran, mundan, annaprashan, vidyarambh, business.
  - Skips Kharmas, Chaturmas and Adhik masa where tradition requires.
  - Excludes Rahu, Yamaganda, Gulika and Bhadra.
  - Every window comes with its reasons. Rules are data in `MuhuratRules.cs` so a pandit can edit them.
- **Mantra, stotra, chalisa and aarti** (56 texts):
  - 35 mantras with sources (Rigveda 3.62.10, 7.59.12, Devi Mahatmya 11.10…): deity gayatris, dhyana shlokas, daily prayers.
  - 21 long texts read verse by verse: Vishnu Sahasranama, Hanuman Chalisa, Aditya Hridayam, Shiva Tandava, Lingashtakam,
    Rudrashtakam, Shiva Panchakshara, Kalabhairava Ashtakam, Nirvana Shatakam, Achyutashtakam, Madhurashtakam,
    Mahishasura Mardini, Mahalakshmi Ashtakam, Lalita Panchakam, Ganesha Pancharatnam, Navagraha Stotram, Om Jai Jagdish Hare…
  - Each long text names where its digital edition comes from (sanskritdocuments.org, vishvAsa/devaH, or the standard printed
    reading). `tools/import_stotras.py` rebuilds `SeedData/mantras/stotras.json`.
  - Filter by mantra / stotra / chalisa and aarti, search, and order by sampradaya.
  - Karaoke highlighting timed by syllable count, speed control and a japa counter (mala ring).
  - Voice guide that only uses a Hindi or Sanskrit voice, never an English one: the phone's own text-to-speech in the
    Android app, or an Indic browser voice on the web (Chrome on Android, Edge). Visarga and avagraha are adjusted so
    Hindi TTS sounds closer to Sanskrit. With no Indic voice the button is hidden and the page says how to add one.
  - Text in Devanagari, IAST, simple Roman, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Bengali, Gujarati or Malayalam.
  - Add `audioUrl` + forced-alignment timings for recorded chants.
- **Granth library** (`/granth`): about 2,75,000 verses in the original, read chapter by chapter, built at deploy time by
  `tools/build_library.py` from public digital editions:
  - **Vedas:** Rigveda (with svaras), Samaveda, Shukla Yajurveda (Madhyandina), Atharvaveda (Shaunaka).
  - **Upanishads:** Katha, Prashna, Shvetashvatara, Aitareya, Chandogya, Brihadaranyaka, Kaivalya, Mandukya Karika (plus Isha and Mandukya with translation).
  - **Upavedas:** Ayurveda (Charaka and Sushruta Samhitas), Dhanurveda (Vasishtha), Gandharvaveda (Natya Shastra), Arthaveda (Kautilya Arthashastra).
  - **Itihasa:** Mahabharata (BORI critical edition, all 18 parvas), Valmiki Ramayana (Baroda critical edition).
  - **Puranas:** Bhagavata, Vishnu, Shiva, Markandeya (with Devi Mahatmya), Brahma, Brahmanda, Garuda, Kurma, Linga, Matsya, Narada, Vamana, Skanda, Agni, Narasimha, Devi Gita.
  - **Darshana and Bhakti:** Yoga Sutra, Ramcharitmanas.
  - Every verse has **✨ Explain**: AI PanditJi gets the exact text and explains it. He can also look passages up himself (`read_granth` tool).
  - The website serves the library; the Android app reads it from the website, so the APK stays small.
- **Gita & Upanishads with translation**:
  - The complete Bhagavad Gita (all 701 verses, read chapter by chapter), the complete Isha and Mandukya Upanishads, and key verses from five more.
  - English translation of the Gita by Swami Sivananda; Hindi for selected verses.
  - BM25 search plus direct references ("Gita 2.47").
  - More texts can be added as JSON (see *Growing the knowledge base*).
- **Sampradaya** (header): All, Vaishnava, Shaiva, Shakta or Smarta. It orders the stotra library, picks the Ekadashi rule,
  highlights the festivals that tradition keeps, and tells PanditJi.
- **Location**: State → District for all 640 census districts (names updated: Telangana, Ladakh, Prayagraj, Ayodhya…),
  12 tirth kshetras, and 32 cities abroad. District points come from DataMeet's 2011 boundaries (CC BY 2.5 India);
  `tools/build_districts.py` rebuilds them.
- **Rashifal** (`/rashifal`, button on the home page and in the menu): today, tomorrow, this week and this month for all 12
  rashis, from the real Moon transit (Chandra gochar) and Sun transit, with lucky colour/number, a simple upay linked to the
  mantra player, and a finder that gives the naam rashi from the first letter of a name (Devanagari or Roman).
- **PanditJi**:
  - Answers any question with Google Gemini's free API (or Groq / OpenRouter) straight from the app, see [FREE_AI.md](FREE_AI.md),
    or with Claude / a free model through the .NET server.
  - Interactive: after every answer PanditJi suggests the three questions you are most likely to ask next, as tappable chips.
  - A floating chatbot on every page (phone and desktop), opening as a chat window; full screen at `/ask`.
  - Claude with tool use: `get_panchang`, `find_muhurat`, `get_mantra`, `search_scriptures`.
  - Answers stream over SignalR; panchang, muhurat, mantra and verse cards render alongside the text.
  - Voice input and read-aloud via the browser Web Speech API in 8 Indian languages.
  - The system prompt forbids inventing shlokas and requires citations from tool results.
- **UI**:
  - 8 languages: हिन्दी, English, ಕನ್ನಡ, தமிழ், తెలుగు, मराठी, বাংলা, ગુજરાતી.
  - Sanskrit names shown in the reader's own script.
  - Self-hosted fonts, keyboard accessible, responsive to 360 px.

## Dakshina and the Android app

- **Dakshina** (`/dakshina`, gold button beside the language and city pickers):
  - Shagun amounts (₹11 to ₹1,100) or any amount you type.
  - A UPI QR code for that amount, the UPI ID `shuklaekant@okhdfcbank` with a Copy button, and, on phones, **Pay with UPI app**, which opens GPay, PhonePe, Paytm or BHIM with the details filled in.
  - The UPI ID and payee name are set in `vedic-pandit-client/src/app/core/app-info.ts`.
- **Android app:** the same Angular code wrapped with Capacitor, the same setup as Cassette.fm.
  - GitHub Actions builds the APK and publishes it as a Release.
  - The website's **Get App** button downloads the newest APK on Android, shows Add to Home Screen steps on iPhone, and shows a QR code to scan on a computer.
  - Setup is in **[ANDROID.md](ANDROID.md)**.

## Put it online (so PanditJi answers everything)

See **[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)**: get a Claude API key, deploy to Render with one click, then set the `API_URL`
repository variable so the GitHub Pages site and the Android app use it.

## Run it

**Prerequisites:** .NET 8 SDK and Node 20+. The backend uses **no NuGet packages**, only what ships with the SDK.

### 1. API

```bash
cd src/VedicPandit.WebAPI
dotnet user-secrets set "Claude:ApiKey" "sk-ant-..."      # optional; without it PanditJi uses built-in answers
dotnet run                                                # http://localhost:5000  (try /api/health)
```

Content (mantras, verses) is loaded from the JSON files in `SeedData/` at startup and held in memory; there is no
database to set up. Imported texts and the chat log are written to the `data/` folder (`Content:DataFolder`).
`VedicPandit.http` has ready-made requests for every endpoint.

### 2. Web app

```bash
cd vedic-pandit-client
npm install
npm start                                                 # http://localhost:4200 → talks to :5000
```

### 3. Tests

```bash
dotnet run --project tests/VedicPandit.Tests
```

41 tests: panchang accuracy against Drik Panchang (sunrise, tithi, nakshatra, yoga, karana, sankrantis, new moons,
festivals, Adhik masa, Smarta/Vaishnava Ekadashi), muhurat rules, the stotra library, the content store and verse search, and PanditJi's tool loop with a scripted
Claude (scripture, panchang, muhurat and mantra tools, API failure, no-key mode). The GitHub workflow `ci.yml` runs them on every push.

### Single deployable

```bash
cd vedic-pandit-client && npm run build:api               # builds Angular into WebAPI/wwwroot
cd ../src/VedicPandit.WebAPI && dotnet publish -c Release
```

Or use Docker: `docker build -t vedic-pandit . && docker run -p 8080:8080 -e Claude__ApiKey=sk-ant-... vedic-pandit`.

## API

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/panchang?date=2026-10-26&lat=25.3176&lng=82.9739&tz=Asia/Kolkata&system=Purnimanta` | Daily panchang |
| `GET /api/panchang/month?year=2026&month=11&...` | Month calendar |
| `GET /api/muhurat/events` | Supported occasions |
| `GET /api/muhurat?event=Vivah&from=2026-11-01&to=2027-01-31&...` | Muhurat windows |
| `GET /api/mantras`, `GET /api/mantras/{slug}` | Mantra library |
| `GET /api/scriptures`, `/api/scriptures/{code}/verses`, `/api/scriptures/search?q=` | Verse library |
| `POST /api/scriptures/import` (header `X-Admin-Key`) | Add verses (JSON like `SeedData/scriptures/*.json`) |
| `GET /api/health` | `{status, ai}`; `ai` is true when a Claude key is set |
| `POST /api/chat` | Non-streaming bot (mobile / WhatsApp integrations) |
| `WS /hubs/panditji` → `Ask({text, language, latitude, longitude, timeZone, sessionId})` | Streaming bot; server pushes `botEvent` |

## Growing the knowledge base

PanditJi only cites what is in the verse library, so answer quality grows with the corpus.

1. Add public-domain texts (Valmiki Ramayana, the principal Upanishads, Yoga Sutras…) either as a file in
   `SeedData/scriptures/` (then run `python3 tools/build_client_data.py` so the website and app get it too) or live through
   `/api/scriptures/import`. `tools/import_gita.py` shows how the Gita was converted from the bhagavadgita.io dataset.
2. Have every translation reviewed by a scholar before it goes live.
3. When the corpus passes a few thousand verses, swap `ScriptureRetriever` (BM25, in memory) for a vector store (pgvector / Azure AI Search) behind the same `IScriptureRetriever` interface.

## Changes from the original specification

| Spec | Here | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Kashi Vishwanath Rishikul vs Shri Rishikesh" data | Computed drik panchang with a Purnimanta/Amanta switch | Those panchangs publish no API. North-Indian panchangs differ mainly in the month convention, which is exposed as an option. |
| Deepgram/Whisper STT | Browser Web Speech API | Free and instant in Chrome, Edge and Safari. Add a server STT for Firefox later (`AudioService` hook). |
| Single intent classifier, then fixed handlers | Claude tool use (multi-step) | A question can need a panchang and a muhurat and a verse; the model chooses and the tools stay deterministic. |
| Tailwind | Hand-written design tokens (`styles.css`) | Small CSS, no build plugin; the palette and type scale are in one place. |
| `localhost` hub URL hard-coded | `API_URL` setting, same-origin by default, `:5000` in dev | Deployable as-is. |
| SQL database | JSON files loaded into memory | The content is read-mostly; no database to host, and the backend builds without NuGet. |

## Known limits

- Muhurat does **not** check lagna shuddhi, Guru/Shukra asta or personal kundali. The UI and bot say so.
- Festival rules cover the major pan-Indian observances. Regional dates (e.g. Gujarati new year, Bengali Durga Puja calendar) need their own rules.
- Rule changes must be made in both C# and TS engines.
- PanditJi cites only verses in the library (the full Gita, Isha and Mandukya, plus 7 Upanishad verses today). For other texts it answers
  from general knowledge and says so.
- Hindi translations exist only for 20 hand-picked Gita verses; other verses show English, and PanditJi answers in Hindi itself.
- Translations: Swami Sivananda (died 1963) is in the public domain in India; check the rules for other countries before
  publishing there. The Sanskrit text and dataset are public domain (Unlicense).

## Verified

- `dotnet build`: 0 warnings, 0 errors. 41/41 tests pass.
- The running API was tested over HTTP: every endpoint, input validation, admin-only import, CORS for the Pages site and the app.
- PanditJi was tested end to end against a mock of the Anthropic streaming API (exact event format, tool calls split
  across chunks): REST, SignalR streaming, scripture/panchang/muhurat/mantra tools, conversation memory, chat log.
- The website was tested in Chromium both ways it will run: served by the .NET app (Docker/Render) and on a separate
  address calling the API (GitHub Pages / Android app), including the chat and the full Gita.
- Not testable here: the real Claude API (needs your key) and the APK build (needs the Android SDK; GitHub builds it).
